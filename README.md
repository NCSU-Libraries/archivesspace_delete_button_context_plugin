archivesspace_delete_button_context_plugin
===================================

Changes the label on the 'Delete' button in the record toolbar to indicate the type of record being deleted.
This addresses an issue where selecting a record in the tree pane sometimes did not update the record pane,
which has resulted in resource records (and all children) being accidentally deleted when the user only meant to delete a component (archival_object) record.
